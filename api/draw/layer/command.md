## command

This type is used to change render command parameters.

> Be cautious when changing stuff in an instance of this type. Passing invalid data to `texture` or `frag_shader`, or not restoring some changes after you're done drawing can lead to undefined behavior, and more likely, a crash. If you are not sure how to operate this type, take a look into examples.

## texture

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: [`ptr`](/api/common-types/ptr "This type is a literal pointer.")

Texture pointer. You can get one from an instance of `texture` type by accessing `obj` field. **Passing invalid data to this field WILL result in a crash**. For a safer way, please use [`set_texture`](/api/draw/layer/command?id=set_texture "Sets a texture in a safe manner.").

## frag_shader

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: [`ptr`](/api/common-types/ptr "This type is a literal pointer.")

Fragment shader (aka Pixel Shader in DirectX terms) pointer. You can get one from an instance of `shader` type by accessing `obj` field. **Passing invalid data to this field WILL result in a crash**. For a safer way, please use `set_shader`.

## clip_rect

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: [`rect?`](/api/draw/common-types/rect "This type is a rectangle used within rendering system.")

Clip rectangle used for scissor testing. If this is set to `nil`, will not clip anything.

> It is advised to instead use layer's `override_clip_rect` method. While you can pass custom rect to this field, you **will** lose information about previous clip rects set before. Using that method will make sure to intersect the previous rect with the one you pass and produce a probably more expected result.

## uv_rect

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: [`rect?`](/api/draw/common-types/rect "This type is a rectangle used within rendering system.")

UV rect used for texture mapping. If this field is set to `nil`, will use `0, 0, 1, 1` rectangle to map the texture. You can learn more about texture mapping in the tutorial section.

## alpha

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `float`

Global opacity override. Defaults to `1`, but if you set anything else - will modulate opacity of every next shape you will render.

## rotation

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `float`

Shape rotation. Not all shapes support this field. The value is set in **degrees**, not radians.

## anti_alias

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `bool`

If set to `true`, will apply tesselation to shapes.

> As of now, not every shape supports tesselation, but it is advised to have it enabled at all times anyway. It will produce much better result anyway.

## ignore_scaling

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `bool`

If set to `true`, will ignore global DPI scale. This is set to `true` by default, but you are free to change it to `false` if you are trying to render some custom UI elements.

## chained_call

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `bool`

Only useful when using shaders. If set to `true`, will **not** update back buffer texture. This can be used if you need the very same texture data, as when applying several shaders to the back buffer.

> Please note that capturing back buffer is a rather **slow** operation. It is better to not capture it too often. Back buffer is automatically captured to the only layer you can use anyway, and it is better to use that one instead, to make sure rendering happens as fast as it is possible.

## only_downsampled

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `bool`

If set to `true`, will capture back buffer (as long as `chained_call` is set to `false`). The name of this field is quite misleading due to the fact that in the CS:GO version of Fatality, it was used to configure if the rendering system should also downsample the captured backbuffer into another texture. In DirectX11, this operation is **much** faster, so it is done regardless.

## capture_back_buffer

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `bool`

An alias to `only_downsampled`.

## is_tile

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: `bool`

If set to `true`, will use a separate texture sampler that supports tiling. By default, all textures are **stretched**, but if you enable this option - their tiling and stretch will be fully configurable by the `uv_rect` field.

## mode

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Type: [`render_mode`](/api/draw/layer/command/render-mode "This enum is used to toggle rendering modes.")

Rendering mode. You can read more about it in the type's documentation.

## set_texture

[![Method][This field is a method and must be invoked using a colon (:).]rw]
