## render_mode

This enum is used to toggle rendering modes.

## normal

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Normal, opaque rendering. All polygons will get filled with color, and texture sampling will be fully supported. This is the default mode to render shapes in layer.

## wireframe

[![Field][This field is a regular field that must be accessed using a dot (.).]rw]

Wireframe rendering. This means that the polygons will no longer be filled with color, nor texture sampling will ever work.
