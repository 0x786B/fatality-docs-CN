## text_alignment

This enum determines how to align the text when drawing it.

> `left` and `top`, as well as `right` and `bottom` are interchangeable. It means that if you use `left` for vertical alignment, it will produce exactly the same result as using `top`, and vice versa. `top`/`bottom` are here only for the sake of convenience and readability.
